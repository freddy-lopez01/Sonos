# Sonos website recreated as a React App  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The site and images all belong to Sonos and its affiliates (please dont sue me). I have been making an effort to recreate web apps of companies and brands that in my opinion set a high standard for UI/UX design.
Sonos was one of these sites and I throughly enjoyed looking at their site and figuring out ways to recreate the site without (obviously) seeing the true source code. This is a expicitly Front-end centered project but practice makes perfect, right. 

# To launch the React app

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
